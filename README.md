### How to contribute to the translations

First, you need an account here on GitHub.com. Go make one if you have not already!

Got an account? Next up, you need to fork this repository by clicking the Fork button up in the top right corner. This will take you to a new page after it's finished, and the URL will be something like `https://github.com/YourUsername/Pixelmon-Language`. Save that webpage, because you will probably want to go there a lot.
